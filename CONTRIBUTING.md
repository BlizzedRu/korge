## Testing

Though not absolutely required, providing tests for the functionality you add or fix would be greatly appreciated.
It is usually harder to provide tests for this kind of projects, but KorGE provides some
useful utilities to do some tests that verify how things might render without actually rendering
like getting vertices that are being flushed by the batcher and so on:

If you need help figuring out how to test something, please, let us know.
